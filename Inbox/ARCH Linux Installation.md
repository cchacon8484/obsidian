### Linux Arch 
A lightweight [[Linux]] distribution where you got total control over the installation and packages.

I really like the process of installation, help me to understand a bit more about the Linux ecosystem and the process that the installation takes. 


Steps
 - [[Download Arch Linux]]
 - [[Mount Flash Drive]]
 - [[Disable Secure boot]]
 - Boot from the mounted Flash drive
 - [[Activate WI-FI in terminal (IWCTL)]]
 - [[Create password for user in Linux]]
 - [[Prepare the hard-drive for Linux]]
