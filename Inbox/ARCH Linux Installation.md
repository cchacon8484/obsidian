### Linux Arch 
A lightweight [[Linux]] distribution where you got total control over the installation and packages.

I really like the process of installation, help me to understand a bit more about the Linux ecosystem and the process that the installation takes. 


Steps
 1. [[Download Arch Linux]]
 2. [[Mount Flash Drive]]
 3. [[Disable Secure boot]]
 4. Boot from the mounted Flash drive
 5. [[Activate WI-FI in terminal (IWCTL)]]
 6. [[Create password for user in Linux]]
 7. [[Prepare the hard-drive for Linux]]
 8. [[Prepare LVM Partitions]] 
 9. [[Format and Mount LVM Partitions]]
